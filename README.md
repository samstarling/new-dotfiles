# dotfiles

Various bits of configuration that I like to have. It assumes the following
things are already installed:

* [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) for managing Ruby versions
* [jenv](https://github.com/gcuisinier/jenv) for managing Java versions
* [vim-pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
* [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

Some other things I use, that aren't in this repo:

* [base-16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) - a theme
* [vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go) - syntax for Go
