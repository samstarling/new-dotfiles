# dotfiles

Various bits of configuration that I like to have. It assumes the following
things are already installed:

* [vim-pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
* [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

Some other things I use, that aren't in this repo:

* [base-16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) - a theme
